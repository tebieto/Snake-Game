# Snake Game

I wrote this game following a tutorial by Christopher chrokh
This game is implemented with functional style  Vanilla Js.
It runs on both browsers and terminals.


# Usage

```bash
git clone git@github.com:chrokh/fp-games.git
cd 001-snake
node cli
```

- Use arrow keys, wasd, or hjkl to control the snake.
- Collect apples.
- Avoid crashing.
- Ctrl-c to quit (in terminal).
